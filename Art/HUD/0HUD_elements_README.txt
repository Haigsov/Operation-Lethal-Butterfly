HUD elements as separate png files with the following naming for ease of use:

	LOCATION_REF_[name].png

The "LOCATION" refers to where on the screen it goes:
	- "HUD" is the bottom HUD ribbon
	- "SQUAD" is the squad bar on the left side
	- "SPRITE" is intended to move with the sprite
	- "HOTBAR" is the hotbar elements on the HUD ribbon
	- "MISC" refers to anything not fitting the above (like the settings icon)

The "REF" tag is only on some images and simply means it's for your reference and not to actually be placed on the screen. You can use these to judge scale and positioning of elements relative to each other's related elements.

Also, I've left out most of the text parts, because it would be better to write them out instead of having an image there. The only text images on there are the "REF" images and the AP text for the HUD (just in-case the typed-out AP text acts all weird you can replace it with the image)
